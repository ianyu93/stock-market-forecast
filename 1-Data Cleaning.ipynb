    "### S&P 500 Index: Proxy to Stock Market\n",
    "The S&P 500 Index dataset is downloaded throuhg [Yahoo! Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/history?p=%5EGSPC). S&P 500 Index is a stock index composed by Standard and Poor's to measure the stock performance of 500 large companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States. It is one of the most followed stock index in the world, and is widely regarded as the best single gauge of large-cap U.S. equities. The dataset consists of daily data of the data. The index is a free-float capitalization-weighted index, that is, companies are weighted in the index in proportion to their market capitalizations. \n",
    "\n",
    "`Date`: Date of the data point, 1973-01-02 to 2020-11-17 in daily format. The market usually opens from Monday to Friday, except on major holidays.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Open`: Index value when the market opens. Note that `Open` is not, though usually quite close, necessarily the `Close` of previous day, as off-market hours trades also affect its values.\n",
    "\n",
    "`High`: The highest point of index value at a given day, typically not equivalent to `Open` nor `Close`. The highest point typically indicates where the resistence is.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Low`: The Lowest point of index value at a given day, typically not equivalent to `Open` nor `Close`. The lowest point typically indicates where the support is.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Close`: The closing, or final, index value of the market on a given day, also the value when people refer to the index value on any given day. \n",
    "\n",
    "`Adj Close`: Adjusted close is adjusted for both dividends and splits. In other words, it is accounting for additional corporate actions that may affect the market, typically used for qualitative research on corporate accounting level. For more detailed explanation on the differences between close and adjusted close can be read [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/adjusted_closing_price.asp).This does not apply to the index itself, however, and as a result contains the same values as `Close`\n",
    "\n",
    "`Volume`: Trading volume is the total number of shares traded on a given day. This represents the magnitude of trading activity. One could have a drastic change in index value despite lower trading volume, so it is always good to check for trading volume to guage the nature of value changes.\n",

    "### 10Y US Government Bond Yields: Proxy to Bond Market\n",
    "The dataset comes from [DataHub](https://datahub.io/core/bond-yields-us-10y). The US government bonds are generally seen as representative of quality fixed income asset. 10Y Government Bond is chosen for it sits right between extremely long-term fixed assets (30Y Bonds) and short-term investment parking (3 months ~ 2 years). Bond yield is the return an investor realizes on a bond. For more details on the bond yield, read [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond-yield.asp).\n",

    "`Date`: Date of the data point, from 1953-04-30 to 2020-06-30, monthly data. \n",

    "`Rate`: 10 year nominal yields on US government bonds from the Federal Reserve. The 10 year government bond yield is considered a standard indicator of long-term interest rates. \n",

    "### Dollar Index or DXY: Proxy to Currency Market\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset also comes from [Yahoo! Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DX-Y.NYB/history?period1=94694400&period2=1606348800&interval=1d&filter=history&frequency=1d&includeAdjustedClose=true). Because currency is always trades against another, the exchange rate is always relative. The Dollar Index is a trade-weighted index of the dollar's strength against a basket of US's most significant trading partners. Although the trading weight of the index has not been updated since the creation of the Euro, thus seen obsolete sometimes, it is still the most followed indicator regarding to the dollar's strength.\n",

    "`Close`: The closing, or final, index value of the market on a given day, also the value when people refer to the index value on any given day. The close price is adjusted for stock splits, as stock splits dramatically changes the price and index-weighting of the stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Adj Close`: As with S&P 500, the `Adj Close` values would be identical to `Close` and thus not useful in our project.\n",

    "\n",
    "West Texas Intermediate oil spot price dataset from [DataHub](https://datahub.io/JohnSnowLabs/brent-and-wti-monthly-spot-prices). WTI historically has been used to track US oil. Although now it has gained global adoptoin and does not discriminate origin, it is still more relavent to the US financial market than other oil index. We are using spot price, meaning the price on the day, instead of futures. While the commodity market is enormous, including cocoa, sugar, and metals, the oil market is one of the most representative and influential commodity in the market. \n",

    "\n",
    "Gold dataset from [Datahub](https://datahub.io/core/gold-prices#data). While gold is a precious metal commodity, it also has a unique status of reserve currency, making it a hedge against bad times. When the market is pessimistic, money often flows from the stock market to gold. Gold is very representative in cross-market sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Date`: 1950-01 to 2020-07, in monthly format. While the market opens on normal trading days, this is one of the few open data that spans beyond 2000. \n",

    "`Price`: Closing price of the month in USD. \n",
    "\n",
    "### CPI: Proxy to Inflation Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important underlying concept of Intermarket Analysis is that the inflation environment also affects how each of the four major markets is correlated with one another. For example, stocks and bonds used to have a positive correlation back in the 70s. Comparing to decades ago, we now are under what is considered a deflationary environment, where we are more worried about not having enough inflation and may even enter deflation. We source the US Consumer Price Index, one of the most prominent index to measure US inflation, from [Federal Reserve Economic Data](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPALTT01USA657N) of St. Louis Fed. As we are taking annual inflation rate to represent the long-term macro environment, FRED does not have inflation rate for 2020 yet. As a result, we are using a forecasted number by [Desjardins](https://www.desjardins.com/ressources/pdf/pefm2008-e.pdf?resVer=1597926090000) for our 2020 inflation rate."

    "Before we concatenate the dataframes, we also need to make sure they have the same number of rows. That means all the dataframes have to be in daily format rather than weekly, monthly, or annual. We will expand the index with `reindex` method and contain only business days. By using `reindex` with a specified date range, we ensure the time series index for every dataframe is the same. We would, however, be introducing new missing values. For annual, monthly and weekly dataframes, as we are expanding into daily dataframes, there are going to be many days that do not have a value of. For the daily dataframes, on the other hand, as reindexing with \"business days\" would actually miss out on statutory holidays landed on weekdays, we will still have the missing values on these statutory holiday weekdays. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding statutory holiday weekdays, `dxy_df` is also a special case here. As mentioned before, it seemed that the missing values were on Sundays only, but in data science, we also need to be thorough. While I'm not showing the messy work here, I did perform deeper dive into the missing values to find out that there are missing values on Satutory Holidays that landed on weekdays. Reindexing fill method would only fill newly introduced missing values, so unlike `spx_df` where it could reindex and fill the newly introduced missing values at the same time, `dxy_df`'s missing values has to be treated *after* reindexing.\n",

    "We also cannot just apply backfill or forwardfill blindly to each dataframe. Note that forwardfill is to bring the last valid data \"forward\" to fill the missing values, while backfill is to bring the next valid data \"backwards\" to fill the missing values. That means for the non-daily dataframes, whether the original data landed on the beginning of the period or the end of the period matters. For example `us10y_df` has its values on the end of month to represent the value of that month (e.g. 2020-01-31), but `gold_df` has its values on the first day of the month (e.g. 2020-01-01). We will use backfill for dataframes that has values at the end of the month, and use forwardfill for dataframes that has its values at the beginning of a period. This is also why we did not merge the dataframes blindly together before performing this operation. "

We also set the Dates as our index for the purpose of analyzing time series data and realign the timeline for all datasets. As we realigned the timeline, we also treated newly introduced missing values individually to ensure the final dataset is not interfered by weekends and statutory holidays on weekdays. Last but not least, we have added a prefix to each of the column, indicating what asset/market does each of the columnn represent before concatenation. \n",
